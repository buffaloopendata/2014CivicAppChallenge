",We do not provide transportation,No meals provided,"The Compeer program is nationally recognized as best practice for mentoring, and follows evidence-based policies and procedures. Compeer’s mentoring program creates strength-based, structured, and trusting one-to-one relationships between caring adults and at-risk youth for support, encouragement, and friendship.  A mentor is not a parent, therapist, guidance counselor, coach, tutor, or probation officer.  And yet, mentored youths are likely to experience better relationships with parents, express goals for their future, improve academic performance, and stay out of the justice system.  High quality mentoring has proven to be a powerful tool to help at-risk youths achieve their true potential."

It’s also great at building the self confidence and getting-along skills of any child. Every child care staff member is trained in Teacher-Child Interaction Training (TCIT) which is a companion to the evidenced based Parent-Child Interactive Therapy (PCIT). These approaches result in quick, positive turnarounds in a child’s behavior, taking on behaviors from disruptive to withdrawn. The outcomes are children with a brighter and much more successful start to school and life.

This Little Light provides high quality care with a bonus: local artists come in for one or two 10-week sessions and teach weekly “hands-on” classes in drama, music, dance, and/or drumming. There is also an art teacher on the staff providing daily experiences in the visual arts. The program is committed to developing the “whole child” through the arts, and works to nurture the spiritual self within each child. The program is also committed to multiculturalism in every aspect, from staffing, to artists and art forms, and to the children enrolled. We explore the rich ethnic and cultural diversity of Buffalo’s West Side, and bring our children together with fun and cooperation.

Why Focus on the Arts?
Since our public schools cut the funds for art and music many years ago, children are not being exposed to these important areas of learning in any significant way. Studies have consistently shown that children who receive instruction in the arts perform better in many seemingly unrelated skills, from math, to interpersonal relations. The arts also provide an outlet for a child’s thoughts and feelings. There are no “wrong” answers. Learning new skills can provide children with positive experiences they may use for the rest of their lives. Finally, what better way to unite children from different backgrounds than through the fun of working together on projects of their own collective creation?",1,355 Richmond Ave,,Buffalo,14222,Tany Haynes,716-885-9443,n/a,"Academic Support/ Homework Help, Arts (Visual, Music, Dance, Theater), Sports/ Recreation/ Fitness, arts and crafts","Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday",2:30 to 5:30,School Year,,30,"Kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th",,"Comparable to other after-school programs.

Without outside assistance, many would be lost in a baffling new school system, in a language that is unfamiliar to them, with cultural rules that can be perplexing, to say the least.We provide one-on-one homework help for all academic subjects and often receive favorable comments from teachers about the completeness of homework as well as an increase in amount of homework turned in. We provide book clubs that work at the level of each student to increase their comfort and love of reading. We provide a structured atmosphere that provides age appropriate rewards for pro-social behaviors.
