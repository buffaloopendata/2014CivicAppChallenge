Here’s an idea from ASNWNY to get you started:

The ASNWNY “After-School Program Navigator” could be an interactive tool for parents, students, after-
school programs, and other interested parties to find information on after-school programs in WNY. The tool 

could also be accessible as a mobile app, through a web-based tool, or through SMS/text based queries. The 

primary goal of this system is to increase the availability and accessibility of information on the location, hours, 

and services provided by after-school programs in WNY. Ideally, a person would submit their local address or 

use GPS, fill in optional search criteria, and then view an interactive map of nearby after-school programs.

To maximize usability for ASNWNY and those they serve:

● Interactive map with the location of programs sites represented by a dot/pin with the ability to click and 

see a info box or scroll down of information on the site

● Accessible through a mobile app, the internet, or through texting

● Opening screen asks if you are a parent/student, provider, vendor, interested in after school in general

○ Any answer directs to a another page that allows you to search for after-school programs with 

variable info based on the audience

● Providers must have the ability to update information relevant to their programs, add new sites, delete 

closed sites, etc

● Language Functionality/integration of Google Translate
